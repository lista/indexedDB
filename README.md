indexedDB
=========

Browser security using indexedDB


This is what I used to test indexedDB. 

1. Run this on Chrome (which provides a way to view the indexedDB database)
2. Open Inspect Element. From here, you van view the logged data on the Console tab
3. Click on Resource tab then expand IndexedDB to see the databases that have been generated plus the object stores in them along with the key/value data pairs.


Next task, integrating this into GO.
